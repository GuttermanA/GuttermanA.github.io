<p>I am a full stack web developer with a background in data analytics. I bring strong analytical and problem solving skills sharpened through more than 3 years of developing performance management solutions for the City of New York. I learned the ins and outs of SQL and database management as my role developed from a Quality Assurance Analyst to a Lead Data Analyst. I discovered programming after working on the back-end for a web based inspection scheduling tool. After that introduction I was hooked and began looking for ways to learn how to code on my own time after work. After several months of self driven study, I decided I wanted to become a full-time developer, so I applied, attended, and graduated from Flatiron School.</p>

<p>My technical skills include: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6/ES7, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, React, Redux, Git, SQL</p>
